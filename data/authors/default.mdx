Mike Barram is an experienced senior full stack developer, architect, manager and technical lead.

At the moment, most of the posts here (those to 2016) are from my time at the University of Manchester. They are copied (with permission) from the WordPress site I set up for the members of my team so that we could document interesting problems we had found or solutions we had developed (or found).

I'm starting to add posts on the more recent projects I have worked on. For now, they are around Python/AI and the implementation of this site, but some posts on .Net applications will be added soon.
