Quoting from http://www.31a2ba2a-b718-11dc-8314-0800200c9a66.com/2008\_03\_01\_archive.html

>“If you create your own procs, prefix those procs to something that you won’t confuse with any other library’s procs, such as ‘cust’ for custom. Of cource, IncludeCustoms is set to true and CustomProcedureStartsWith should be set to ‘cust\_{0}\_’ so that a table name of Profile should have a custom proc of cust\_Profile\_SelectAll.”

if you set CustomProcedureStartsWith to just ‘cust\_’ as we have done in the past, a method is created for each stored procedure for each table, whereas using ‘cust\_{0}\_’ only creates one method for each stored procedure – that method is linked to the table its name is based on. Far more sensible.
