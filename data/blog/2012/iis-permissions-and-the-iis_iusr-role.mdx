some web applications need access to the “temporary asp.net files” folder. The IIS\_IUSR role already has read/write access to it but sometimes (i.e. the ePortfolio system) it needs to create a folder and can’t do that, even when the AppPoolIdentity account is a member of the IIS\_IUSR role. In that case I just created the folder and it was fine…

There could be a further problem when the AppPoolIdentity is a domain account:
