I’d set up the MedicineExaminers system to not allow nulls on any fields – they were supposed to contain empty strings if there was no data e.g. no email address.

The NetTiers generated site didn’t like this as it made the fields required. I’ve changed the fields to allow nulls and so now, if I have an empty text box, NetTiers sets the value to null in the database.

Lookup lists (e.g. speciality) will have values such as “not known”, so foreign keys will never need to be null.
