You may want your custom stored procedures to contain conditional statements such as ```IF```. These can cause problems when NetTiers inspects the procedure to determine its outputs â€“ it may normally return a table but an ```IF``` statement traps for an exception and conditionally returns before the select statement. You can force NetTiers to follow one route through the code e.g. the statement below will never return for NetTiers

```
IF user_name() <> 'NetTiersUserAccount' AND ThingToTest = ValueThatMakesItReturn RETURN
```

Just make sure that the user account in the connection string used by NetTiers is not used by anything other than NetTiers i.e. not in you web.config
