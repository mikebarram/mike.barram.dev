# Current usage of WordPress in MHS

[http://blogs.mh.manchester.ac.uk](http://blogs.mh.manchester.ac.uk) is a multi-site installation with 61 sites, 30 of which have been updated in the last 6 months. The largest use is for the [MHS New Hub](https://blogs.bmh.manchester.ac.uk/news-hub/) which manages all of the news content displayed on the Faculty’s external websites.

Separate installations for 2 research projects in NMSW –

- [FarseeingReasearch.eu](http://FarseeingReasearch.eu) EU funded international research collaboration
- [CSNat.org](http://CSNat.org) A site for communicating information for a pilot in collaboration with the NHS.

Pilot ePortfolio project. A separate multi-site installation with a lot of customisations and using HTTPS

Tim Cappelli runs a number of sites independantly of the MHS Web Team, which we occasionaly provide advice for.

Laura Bond is in the process of setting up a site to support IPAD useage amoungst a Masters course, based off an exisiting site created by Tim Cappelli for Medical Students.

## Hosting problems

Linux hosting always seems more difficult than it should be.  Historically this has been down lack of resource in the Linux Team.

Linux farm doesn’t support HTTPS – ePortfolios had to be set up in a VM under VMware to meet deadlines. After deadline was met the member of the Linux team did propose a solution.

Linux farm configuration (something to do with with proxying) stops one-click updates working, so updates have to be done manually.

## Other problems with WordPress

Maintenance of individul plugins.  Plugins need analysing and testing before they implemented and during upgrades. Plugins may stop being supported by the 3rd party that created them and may need to be replaced with an alternative. This may happen without any prior warning.

## Advantages of WordPress over SharePoint

Easy to set up sites with non-Manchester domain names and design for collaborative projects

Blogs can be private but the default is to be public. The [NMSW research blog](https://blogs.bmh.manchester.ac.uk/snmswresearch/), which is linked from the external [research home page](http://www.nursing.manchester.ac.uk/research/), is a good example of a blog which is most likely to be read by the internal audience but that gives an insight into the activity in the school.

Wider range of use within HE, so more information and plugins for e.g. use as an ePortfolio

Huge range of training material online, so easy to find some that’s pitched at the right level for the user

Android and iOS apps for WordPress

CAS authentication – unfortunately this stops users connecting via apps

Images can be dragged into a post and they will be added to the media library and them embedded, making it feel more like editing a Word document than using a CMS

## Disadvantages of WordPress (as used now)

Lots of separate installations, so lots to update.

Many of the individual installations are managed by the non-technical owner, so they may not keep them up to date or understand the security implications of no doing so.

Staff can easily find themes and plugins that they would like, so we are often under pressure to install them. Without thorough testing, this can be risky, which is why individuals (often in eLearning) end up with their own installations.
