Omu.ValueInjecter is great for quickly casting one entity to another, especially when the property names match up, as there’s no configuration to do.

This is really handy if you have a view model that’s just a cut down version of your model and you want to get the data from the model into the view model.

If you’ve got a list of model entities that you want to cast to a list of view model entitites, you can do so without looping through them:

```C#
var MyViewModels = db.MyModel.ToList().Select(p => new MyViewModel().InjectFrom(p)).Cast<MyViewModel>();
```
