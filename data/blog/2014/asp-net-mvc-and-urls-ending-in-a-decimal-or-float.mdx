In your MVC site, you might want this URL to purchase 2.5 kilos of cheese for you  
https://www.mysite.com/cheese/purchase/2.5  
Unfortunately it won’t be recognised as a route to the purchase method within the cheese controller. The good news is that this will work:  
https://www.mysite.com/cheese/purchase/2.5/ Note the extra slash at the end

This is an explanation why:

It’s fairly unusual to have a valid reason for a URL like this. If you want to pass a parameter that’s a float, it’s more likely that you would want to post the data.
