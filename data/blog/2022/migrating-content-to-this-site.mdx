I'd previously written blog posts in WordPress but this site uses Markdown instead. The migration process was simply a case of exporting the old posts from WordPress (there's a button in WordPress to do this) and Google "WordPress XML export to markdown", which resulted in me using this:
https://github.com/lonekorean/wordpress-export-to-markdown

There were various warning about deprecated dependencies but, running the script with npx, they weren't installed.
The blog posts were converted to markdown in a few seconds and then there was the process of tidying it up, especially embedded images/code and the [FrontMatter](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog#frontmatter).

It was useful to find someone else who was creating similar content in markdown. This page has examples of pretty much every type of content formatting that I'd want to use:

The markdown for this is here:
