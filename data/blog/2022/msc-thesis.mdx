I've just uploaded to Github a copy of my MSc thesis on [Computer Vision and Analysis of the Carotid Artery](https://github.com/mikebarram/MSc-Thesis)

I hadn't looked at my thesis for a while but I was thinking that it might be a nice idea to replicate it as a modern web application with the number crunching handed off to the most appropriate cloud service. Looking at what I did back then, re-implementing the algorithms in a different language and then recreating the 3D graphics will be quite a challenge...
